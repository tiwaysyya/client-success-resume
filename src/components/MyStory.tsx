          <p>
            Started in biotechnology research at Imperial. Moved into equity analysis, patent strategy and climate ventures.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Now I evaluate sustainability risks, model regulatory headwinds and synthesise scientific, policy and market evidence into actionable investment insights.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I work best where scientific complexity meets investment judgement and stewardship-aligned research.
