          <p>
            Imperial Biotechnology graduate. But I've never been content just studying—I build things, lead teams, and chase problems worth solving.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I've led societies, grown communities 50%, won pitch competitions, shipped research at speed, and built tools to automate my own workflows. No one asked me to do any of it.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I thrive when given ownership, ambiguity, and a problem that matters. Give me a seat at the table and I'll figure out the rest.
