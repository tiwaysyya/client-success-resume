            I started in biotechnology at the bench, where every experiment was like a puzzle. It taught me to think critically, stay persistent and troubleshoot quickly — but I realised that science was only one part of a much bigger story, and I wanted my impact to reach further than the lab.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That curiosity pushed me across product development, startup operations, IP strategy and equity research. Moving between these worlds meant learning fast, adapting in unfamiliar environments and building a differentiated perspective on how life science value is created, protected and commercialised.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I don't approach problems through a single lens. I map the incentives, constraints and opportunities across the system and build tailored solutions rather than apply templates. That approach has helped shape investment discussions, strengthen patents, refine commercial roadmaps and highlight growth opportunities others hadn't recognised yet.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I work best where scientific complexity meets commercial or strategic judgement — and I'm building deeper capability in R, SQL and modelling to scale that impact.
