          <p>
            Imperial Biotechnology graduate. But I've never been content just studying. I build things, lead teams, and chase problems worth solving.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I've led societies, trained teams of 10+, grown communities 50%, won pitch competitions, and built tools to solve my own problems. I take initiative, and I know how to bring others along.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I thrive when given ownership and room to figure things out. Give me a seat at the table and I'll make things happen.
