          <p>
            Biotechnology graduate from Imperial College London. I started in the lab, but I have always been more interested in building things than staying in one lane. I like spotting problems, taking ownership, and leading teams.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Alongside my degree, I have led student societies, trained and managed teams of over 10 people, grown communities by more than 50%, won pitch competitions, and built tools to solve problems I ran into myself. Most of that work started because something was not working and I decided to fix it rather than wait for instructions.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I do my best work in fast moving environments where priorities shift and resources are limited. Give me ownership, trust, and a real problem to solve, and I will take it from idea to outcome while bringing others with me.
