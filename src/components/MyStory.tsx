            Imperial Biotechnology graduate. Built analytical rigour through equity research, startup strategy and patent diligence.

            Now I turn chaotic complexity into simple, scalable solutions—optimising products, processes and customer experiences through data-driven analysis.

            I thrive in lightning-fast environments where ownership, curiosity and speed drive results.
